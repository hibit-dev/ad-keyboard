# How to use the AD Keyboard module with Arduino
When working on simple Arduino projects that need basic navigation or input, the AD keyboard module is a handy little tool. It's a 5-button unit that behaves like a directional pad, with four arrow-style buttons and one additional button. It doesn't require any soldering or setup, which makes it a practical choice for prototyping or small projects. You can plug it in and start using it right away, thanks to its three-pin layout and built-in resistors.
